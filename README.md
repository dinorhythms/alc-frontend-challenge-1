## Project description

We want to develop a small web app that allows users to order pizza.

First of all we'll display the list of pizzas with ingredients and prices. Data will be loaded from `server/pizzas.json`.

When the user chooses something from the list the order summary will update dynamically.

There will be a button to confirm the order. An fetch on 
`server/order.json` and the result will be displayed as a message like this: "Your order will be delivered in x minutes".

You can use any library/framework/plugin you want.

Please use some template library ([http://handlebarsjs.com/](http://handlebarsjs.com/), [http://mustache.github.io/](http://mustache.github.io/), ...).

The application must be single page and JS-based using AngularJS (1.x is fine if not familiar with 2.x), ReactJS, Vuejs . That means that I load just one html file, if you want to add some navigation you have to implement it via JS.

If you can display discounts for pizzas it's a plus.

## Evaluation

Our goal is to find answers to those questions:

- Do you understand the JavaScript language and more in general web technologies?
- Can you judge which library/framework is the best fit for a job and use it correctly?
- Can you design interfaces that are clear and easy to use?
- Do you master your working environment?

Due to the limited time consider the followings:

- It is NOT important to have a fully functional application at the end.
- We'll develop just for the latest version of Google Chrome.
